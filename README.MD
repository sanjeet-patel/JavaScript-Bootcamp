# Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to the Programming Practice Repository! This repository is designed to help you improve your programming skills by providing a collection of coding challenges and projects categorized by difficulty levels. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an advanced developer seeking a challenge, you'll find something here to sharpen your coding skills.

## Beginner

### FizzBuzz - Day 1
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

### Reverse a String - Day 2
Write a function that reverses a string. For example, the string "hello" should be reversed to "olleh".

### Calculate the Factorial of a Number  - Day 3
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 (1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5).

### Find the Fibonacci Sequence  - Day 4
Write a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.

## Intermediate

### Implement a Bubble Sort  - Day 5
Write a function that sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in an array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

### Implement a Linked List - Day 6
Write a function that creates a linked list. A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes that are linked together. Each node in a linked list contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list.

### Implement a Binary Search Tree - Day 7
Write a function that creates a binary search tree. A binary search tree is a data structure that stores data in a sorted order. Each node in a binary search tree has two children: a left child and a right child. The left child of a node contains all the values that are less than the value of the node, and the right child of a node contains all the values that are greater than or equal to the value of the node.

## Advanced

### Implement a Min-Heap - Day 8
Write a function that creates a min-heap. A min-heap is a data structure that stores data in a partially sorted order. The smallest element in a min-heap is always stored at the root of the heap.

### Implement a Max-Heap - Day 9
Write a function that creates a max-heap. A max-heap is a data structure that stores data in a partially sorted order. The largest element in a max-heap is always stored at the root of the heap.

### Implement a Graph - Day 10
Write a function that creates a graph. A graph is a data structure that stores relationships between objects. Each object in a graph is called a vertex, and each relationship between two objects is called an edge.

### Implement a Backtracking Algorithm - Day 11
Write a function that implements a backtracking algorithm. A backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that tries all possible solutions to a problem.
